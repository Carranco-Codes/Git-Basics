# Git-Basics
These commands can be accessed through GitHub’s Git Cheat Sheet. GitHub is a tool that is required
at just about every job. However, it is so typical of a tool that even if it isn’t listed as a requirement, just
know that your employer will most likely expect you to have an understanding of GitHub. That said,
these are the most basic commands you must know.
