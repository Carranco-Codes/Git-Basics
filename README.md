### Directory
A folder. Example: C:/Users/ contains two directories, "C:/" and "Users/".

### cd
Short for "Change Directory". It is a command in the terminal that allows for you to "change directory". To tell the terminal that you are in the current directory you use that command "./" To go up a level you use the command "../"
Example: C:/Users/Jose 
My current directory is Jose. If I want to go to the "C:/" directory I use the command "../../"

### ls
Shows a list of all the files in your current directory.

### cp

Example: to copy the file to the same directory
cp "filename" "new filename"

Example: to copy the file to a new directory

### mv
Command to move a file. Similar to cp, but instead of duplicating a file, this command allows you to move the file to a new directory.

### mkdir

Example: mkdir "newFolder" will create a new directory in your current directory.
