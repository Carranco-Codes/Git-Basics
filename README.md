The Git Workflow is probably the hardest concept to understand in Git. It doesn't have to be complicated though. This diagram simply breaks down the Git Workflow visually.

### Working Repository
The first environment of the Git workflow. These are files that exist on both your current branch and on your computer 

### Stage Area
This is sometimes referred to as the index. In this environment you package files that you want to commit to the remote repository. You can add as many files as you want to this environment but essentially, this is where you group the files you want to commit. 
  
Example: You want to change the homepage and the change consists of 4 files to be updated. You can add all four files from your Working Directory to the Stage Area. 

### Local Repository
This is often referred to as the HEAD and is your local copy of the remote repository. This environment contains the latest files since you last interacted with GitHub. This third environment is also the last place where files exist before getting pushed up to GitHub or getting pulled to your Working Repository.   

### Remote Repository
The fourth and final environment of the Git Workflow. Because we are using GitHub these files live on GitHub. These are all files of all branches that have been pushed to GitHub.
